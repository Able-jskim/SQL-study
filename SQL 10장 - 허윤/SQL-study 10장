SELECT 
   COALESCE(category, 'all') AS category
   , COALESCE(sub_category, 'all') AS sub_category
   , SUM(price) AS amount
FROM purchase_detail_log 
group by ROLLUP(category, sub_category)

롤업 - UNION ALL 보다 연산량 적음. // 책 내용

ROLLUP구문은 GROUP BY 절과 같이 사용 되며, 
GROUP BY절에 의해서 그룹 지어진 집합 결과에 대해서 
좀 더 상세한 정보를 반환하는 기능을 수행 한다.
SELECT절에 ROLLUP을 사용함으로써 보통의 SELECT된 데이터와 그 데이터의 총계를 구할 수 있다.
